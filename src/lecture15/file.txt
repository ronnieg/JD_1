The Pittsburgh Penguins are a professional ice hockey team based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
They are members of the Metropolitan Division of the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League.
The franchise was founded in 1967 as one of the first expansion teams during the league's original expansion from six to twelve teams.
The Penguins played in the Civic Arena, also known as The Igloo, from the time of their inception through the end of the 2009–10 season, when they moved to the PPG Paints Arena.
The 1992–93 Penguins won the franchise's first-ever Presidents' Trophy for being the team with the most points at the end of the regular season.
In addition to their eight division titles, they have qualified for six Stanley Cup Finals, winning the Stanley Cup five times – in 1991, 1992, 2009, 2016, and 2017.
Along with the Edmonton Oilers, the Penguins are tied for the most Cup championships among non-Original Six teams and sixth overall. With their Stanley Cup wins in 2016 and 2017,
the Penguins became the first back-to-back champions in 19 years (since the 1997–98 Detroit Red Wings) and the first team to do so since the introduction of the NHL salary cap.
The franchise have qualified for the playoffs a total of 33 times and currently have the the longest streak of postseason appearances in the league with 12 straight seasons.
The Penguins have developed rivalries with multiple NHL franchises over the years, most notably the Philadelphia Flyers (known as the Battle of Pennsylvania), Washington Capitals, New York Islanders and the Columbus Blue Jackets.
Eleven former players of the Penguins have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Nine players—Andy Bathgate, Tim Horton, Mario Lemieux, Ron Francis, Paul Coffey, Bryan Trottier, Luc Robitaille, Jaromír Jágr,
and Sidney Crosby—were in 2017 named among the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history.
